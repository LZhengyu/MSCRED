# MSCRED
Implementation of paper: A Deep Neural Network for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis in Multivariate Time Series Data

This code is modified according to the demo code provided by the author: https://github.com/7fantasysz/MSCRED. Since the source code is written in linux style and maybe some files or variables of the code are renamed or missed, the code can not run directly. I deleted the code that I think is problematic or unnecessary, and kept most of the source code, so that the code can be run directly on win10 with python3.
